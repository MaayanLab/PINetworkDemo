One of the primary challenges of working with publication and authorship networks, is the problem of Author Name Disambiguation (AND), which is the task of identifying who is who. For example, someone may have entered their name on one publication as First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name, but on another publication wrote it as First Name, Middle Name, Last Name. This obviously is a complicated problem throughout bibliometrics, so for the sake of simplicity, we assume that all author's with the exact same names are the same, and authors that have the same middle initial and matching first and last names are also the same. Let us  create our list of unique nodes of Authors. We can get this information by retrieving all of the contact pi names found in [grants.csv](./grants.csv) as well as the publication names stored in [pmid_metadata.csv](./pmid_metadata.csv).
